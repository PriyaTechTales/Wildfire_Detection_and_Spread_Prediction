# Wildfire Detection and Spread Prediction

This project is a full-stack web application designed to assist in early *wildfire detection* and *predict the potential spread* of fire. It integrates *deep learning (YOLOv8)* for detecting fire/smoke and *machine learning (Random Forest Regressor)* for predicting fire spread using environmental conditions.

> *Tech Stack:* Django | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | YOLOv8 | Random Forest | SQLite

## ðŸš€ Features

- *Fire Detection using YOLOv8*
  - Detects Fire, Smoke, or No Fire in uploaded images.
  - Uses deep learning for real-time prediction with confidence scores.

- *Spread Prediction using ML*
  - Predicts wildfire spread area and intensity using environmental parameters.
  - Powered by Random Forest Regressor for accurate regression predictions.

- *Frontend*
  - Built with *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript* for responsiveness and interactivity.

- *Backend*
  - Developed using *Django* for robust server-side logic and secure data flow.

- *Database*
  - Uses *SQLite* to store user data, results, and logs.

- *Visualizations*
  - Interactive graphs to show prediction trends and detection results.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### 1. Wildfire Detection
- User uploads an image.
- YOLOv8 model detects fire, smoke, or no fire.
- Results are shown with bounding boxes and confidence percentages.

### 2. Spread Prediction
- User fills a form with inputs like temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.
- ML model returns predicted wildfire spread in square meters.
- Result is displayed with visual aid.
